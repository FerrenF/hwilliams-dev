            <h2>Welcome, and thank you for visiting!</h2>
            <p>I am eager to embark on a professional journey that aligns with my passion: solving real-world problems through the innovative application of algorithms,
                statistics, and machine learning. With the rapid growth of opportunities driven by technology and research,
                I am excited to bring my skills to impactful projectsâ€”perhaps with your team!</p>


            <h3>Educational Background</h3>
            <p>To build a strong foundation in technology and problem-solving, I've achieved a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
                from <a href="https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/">Georgia Southern University</a> and an
                Associate of Applied Science in Information Technology from <a href="https://www.southeasterntech.edu/">Southeastern Technical College</a>,
                both located in Georgia, USA. These programs equipped me with both theoretical and practical expertise in computer science and IT.</p>

            <h3>Key Skills:</h3>
            <p>I am confident in my ability to contribute in the following areas:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>Analyzing complex problems and assessing the feasibility of implementing <b>machine learning</b> algorithms to address them effectively.</span></li>
                <li><span>Developing and managing web applications, including both <b>frontend and backend</b> systems.</span></li>
                <li><span>Collaborating in team-oriented software development projects within Agile environments.</span></li>
                <li><span>Adapting to multi-platform tools and technologies to meet evolving production needs.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Skills to hit the ground running:</h3>
            <p>The above skills might be especially attractive, but if your team sees any of the following, then I can hit the ground running for you.</p>
